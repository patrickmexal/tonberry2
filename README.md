This is one of two beta designs I built for my second Bootcamp Project, now known as Tonberry 1.0 (The other one can be found at https://patrickmexal.github.io/tonberry_reborn/). And a view of the finished product can be found at https://patrickmexal.github.io/curtain_call/ .

It was built using Foundation, and I think exhibits a calm, somewhat Zen aesthetic.
